These constraints will be read post-synthesis (as long as their source constraint file is marked as used_in_implementation) and should be applied correctly then. You should review the constraints listed in the file [.Xil/top_SCPU_propImpl.xdc] and check the run log file to verify that these constraints were correctly applied.

Resolution: To avoid this warning, move constraints listed in [.Xil/top_SCPU_propImpl.xdc] to another XDC file and exclude this new file from synthesis with the used_in_synthesis property (File Properties dialog in GUI) and re-run elaboration/synthesis.
